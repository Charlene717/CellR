# CellR
CellR is a single cell-based data-driven method to recover and quantify the cellular composition of bulk transcriptional data. It is a fully unsupervised approach based on clustering the reference single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) followed by extracting the unique marker genes defining each cell cluster.
